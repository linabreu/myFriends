# myFriends
Program uses an ArrayList to keep track of the user's friends

How It Works:

Program prompts the user to enter the names of friends, which are then put into the ArrayList; it allows them to keep adding names until they enter "q" to quit.

After input is complete, it displays a numbered list of all friends in the list and prompts the user to enter the number of the friend they wish to delete. After deleting that entry, it outputs the new list of friends.
